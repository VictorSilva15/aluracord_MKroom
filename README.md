# Aluracord MKRoom

This repository store the source code of a chat application built in NextJS. The code was built in alura's React event, and here I styled the code to make it unique and creative! Basically the application uses @skyneui/components to build a beautiful interface, react-tilt, that's a lib to use [Vanilla-tilt](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/) effect, and lodash so that the application can wait while the user typing the input data, and just after he stop, the code runs (This technique avoid the application make request every time without necessity)
